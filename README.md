// Brandon Van Horn Review: Well Designed and close to the figma i like the hover on the days for more info very clean!

/*
 Darcy Rose - The great: The HTML and CSS portions are spot on. I like the ease out on the hover transition. Good use of query selectors to optimize code.
 Areas for potential improvement: The search will take strings of just numbers and return locations, so that may be something to tweak.  I noticed the favorites aren't clickable to return you to that page, which would be a good feature to add. Also the highs and lows seem to be inaccurate for some of them, there's a difference of 0-4 degrees between the two. Are you pulling from all 8 time segments in the forecast and taking the highest and lowest?
 Overall, a very solid job, cleanly executed with efficient coding and an impeccable eye for matching design. Well done!
